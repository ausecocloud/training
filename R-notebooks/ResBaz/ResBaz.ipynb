    "# From BCCVL to _ecocloud_: further analyses on the modelling data\n",
    "While BCCVL gives you a comprehensive suite of results in your SDM experiment, you might want to do some further analyses that are not included in the BCCVL yet. Here we showcase how you can do some easy data explorations using the data from your SDM. For example, you might be interested in checking:\n",
    "- What is the range and the average of the values of my climatic variables? For example - how much does the precipitation vary across all the locations in which the species has been observed?\n",
    "- How often is the species reported at a given point in the climatic variable? For example - is the species most frequently observed in areas with 100mm of precipitation or 1000mm of precipitation? Are there any gaps in the environmental variable values across your occurrence records?\n",
    "- How much are the variables in my model correlated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will step you through how you might want to address some of these questions using _ecocloud_ and R Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Obtaining your data from BCCVL\n",
    "If you haven't already, you will need to download one of the output files from the BCCVL for the next analysis. \n",
    "- Under the Results tab of your experiment, select one algorithm. \n",
    "- Click the drop down ‘more’ button, which will show all the results for that algorithm.\n",
    "- Search for the ‘Occurrence points with environmental data’ output, and click the blue download button behind this result.\n",
    "- Double check that this is the correct file. The filename has the following format: \"occurrence_environmental_species.name_algorithm.csv\".\n",
    "- Save this file somewhere that you can access it in the next session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Uploading your data in _ecocloud_\n",
    "__Before uploading data, make sure you are currently sitting in the 'workspace' folder (as opposed to 'home'). This will ensure that your files are saved in your _ecocloud_ account.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's first create a new folder to store all the files of this workshop. Click the 'New folder' icon. This creates an 'Untitled Folder'.\n",
    "- Right click the folder, and select Rename. Name your folder 'ResBaz'.\n",
    "- Double click the ResBaz folder to make sure you are working in that.\n",
    "- Click the 'Upload files' button in the top of the panel on the left.\n",
    "- Find the csv file that you downloaded from BCCVL. This will now be saved in your ResBaz folder.\n",

    "## Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks <a name=\"notebook\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow you to create a live document in which you can edit text, code and equations, or share results. The advantage of using a Jupyter notebook is that you are able to work and annotate your data, which you may want to share with colleagues, or use in published materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "In *ecocloud*, we use Jupyter notebooks for this reason. It lets you work on a document and save it for later. For more of an introduction on using Jupyter itself, head to our **[support page](https://support.ecocloud.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000200389-using-jupyter-notebooks)** or on the **[Jupyter website](http://jupyter.org/)**.\n",

    "- Markdown: these are used for comments. Check this page for useful [Markdown tips](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQNUZ_current/com.ibm.icpdata.doc/dsx/markd-jupyter.html).\n",
    "- Code: these are used for R or Python code. The coding language that you can run depends on what kind of server you have running in *ecocloud*.\n",
    "- Raw: can be used to write output directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the commands on the top of the notebook to (from left to right):\n",
    "- Save your notebook.\n",
    "- Add a new cell (these are by default code, so if you want the cell to be markdown, change this in the drop-down menu.\n",
    "- Cut selected cells.\n",
    "- Copy selected cells.\n",

    "When you open your server in *ecocloud* you will automatically see your workspace loaded in the menu on the left. You can open a notebook from here, or find a notebook elsewhere. For example:\n",
    "- Go to a **Google Drive** folder by clicking the Google Drive icon.\n",
    "- Go to a **GitHub repository**. As an example: click the GitHub icon (the cat icon, 3rd from the top). By default you will see the *ecocloud* training repository. If you are running an R server, click on the R-notebooks folder and open the notebook you want to work with.\n",
