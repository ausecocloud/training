# Polygons - README

In this folder you will find some polygon files in `*.wkt` format.

The `well known text` (wkt) is a standard format used in [Shapely](shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) to store text files representing geometry objects.

Use these files to run Polygon region selections in SilverEye.
